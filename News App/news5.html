        <h1 class="heading content-heading">The investor drained $110 million in cryptocurrencies from the platform.</h1>

        <p class="para full-para">Avraham Eisenberg, the crypto investor whose ‘highly profitable trading strategy’ drained DeFi trading platform Mango Markets of crypto worth $110 million, was arrested Monday in Puerto Rico, court documents said.
            The self-described game theorist admitted his role in draining Mango Markets’ treasury shortly after the incident in mid-October, and may now be the first U.S. resident to face charges for his role in manipulating a decentralized-finance trading platform.
            Eisenberg faces charges of commodities fraud and commodities manipulation, according to a filing unsealed Tuesday. The charges could see punishments ranging from fines to prison time.
            <br/><br/>
            A deposition signed by FBI Special Agent Brandon Racz alleges Eisenberg ‘willfully and knowingly’ manipulated the sale of a commodity – namely futures contracts on Mango Markets.
            ‘Eisenberg engaged in a scheme involving the intentional and artificial manipulation of the price of perpetual futures contracts on a cryptocurrency exchange called Mango Markets, and other manipulative and deceptive devices and contrivances.’
